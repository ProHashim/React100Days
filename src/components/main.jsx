                                At its most basic level, the class keyword in ES6 is equivalent to a constructor function definition that conforms to prototype-based inheritance. It may seem redundant that a new keyword was introduced to wrap an already existing feature but it leads to
                                readable code and lays the foundation upon which future object oriented features can be built.ðŸ˜‰ Read more <a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/demystifying-es6-classes-and-prototypal-inheritance">here</a>
